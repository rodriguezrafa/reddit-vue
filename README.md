Vue SPA for listing Reddit Post. This is a test for a FrontEnd Role

### Step by Step

After setting the project up with Vue CLI 3, I usuallu start by creating the component list Iĺl be using during the project. After that I start with the HTML and CSS code because most of the time the backend team is working at the same time in the models and some other stuff Iĺl be needing in some part, so fetching the real data will be the last thing Iĺl do.

I created a Trello Kanban board to keep track of each step just for this test because in dayly bases I use Jira but there's no need of creating new branches for such a small project

1. Layout & Responsiveness

    There's a simple flexbox grid. The left column will hide at 992px or less and there will be a toggle menu button to show the post list
